            <p>When building a website, I focus on the business, location, and online competitors, to ensure I build a website that helps grow the business. 
                In todays world, websites need to work on all screen sizes, so my websites are designed to do just that and are built with responsive layouts.

                Unique Branding
            </h3>
            <p>
                
               When working with this client I wanted to ensure that their website reflected their unique personality and image. 
               I also wanted to build a custom website so it reflected their branding and minimized the amount of time it took them to book appointments.</p>

            <h3 class="fw-bolder text-uppercase">Custom Promotions</h3>
            <p>One of the visitor-to-lead conversion mechanism we wanted to implement was the ability for a visitor to claim a coupon via e-mail or text message. The idea behind this is that if the visitor wanted to redeem a coupon they would supply an e-mail or phone number.</p>

            <h3 class="fw-bolder text-uppercase">Appointment Booking</h3>
            <p>Another important feature was the capability to book an appointment online. A customer would visit their website find an available time and then the shop would receive an e-mail notification.</p>

                The email design was another opportunity to let the brandâ€™s personality and value shine through.
