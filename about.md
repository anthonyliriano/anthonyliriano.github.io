    <h2>About</h2>
        <p> 
            I'm a Anthony Liriano: Creator, Entrepreneur, and Software Developer in Massachusetts.  
        </p>
        <p>
            As a self-taught developer, I have been fortunate enough to have a variety of online resources where I've been able to learn from and grow. While still early on my journey, I hope to give back as much as information as I can. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I blog mostly about technology, code, the web, and anything I find interesting.
