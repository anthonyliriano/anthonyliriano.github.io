I'm a Software Engineer working for a _Promotional Products Company_ in the New England Area. 

I blog mostly about technology, code, the web, and anything I come across on my journey to becoming a better software developer.

Outside of work, I do a lot of running, and Iâ€™m hoping to run a marathon (26.219 miles) before the end of 2019.
