I'm a Software Engineer working for a _Promotional Products Company_ in the New England Area . I look after our internal single page applications built on Angular and maintain and enhance our internal RestFUL APIs. I blog mostly about technology, code, the web, where we're going and where we've been.

Outside of work, I do a lot of running, and Iâ€™m hoping to run a marathon (26.219 miles) before the end of 2019.
