I'm a Anthony Liriano: Creator, Entrepreneur, and Software Developer in Massachusetts.  

I blog mostly about technology, code, the web, and anything I find interesting. 

As a self-taught developer, I've been fortunate enough to have a variety of online resources where I've been able to learn from and grow. While still early on my journey, I hope to give back as much as information as I can.
