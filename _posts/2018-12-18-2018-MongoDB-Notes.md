# MongoDB Notes

Unfortunately, at the time when I decided to start documenting my experimentation with MongoDB, I had already deployed a replica set. This post will assume that you have a working MongoDB instance.

## Context
My organization is currently experimenting with MongoDB to store records that contain information of the modified items (previous value, modified value, field, username, etc) . We've turned to MongoDB since the records will be dynamic and may evolve as a product catalog grows..  

## Terminology 

* A "Replica Set" is a _group of MongoDB instances (3 or more) that maintain the same data set_. This is how MongoDB can ensures high availability. 
* A Replica set can have multiple nodes reflecting the primaries data set.
* Must have only one primary capable of confirming writes. 
* The rest of the "data nodes" reflect the primaries data set.
* If primary is unavailable, an eligible secondary will hold an election to elect itself the new primary.
* Arbiters do not maintain a data set (extra mongod instances in a replica set) and cannot become a primary
* Arbiters offer a +1 vote thus allowing an uneven # of votes; resource cost effective way to select a replica.

* To print out the Replica Set Configuration run the command below - 

`rs.config()`

```


```


* By Default clients read from the primary; however clients can specify a read preference ??????
