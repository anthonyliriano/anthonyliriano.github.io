# MongoDB Notes

Unfortunately, at the time when I decided to start documenting my experimentation with MongoDB, I had already deployed a replica set. This post assumes that you have a working MongoDB instance or you're looking to get an overview of the technology. 

## Context

My organization is currently experimenting with MongoDB to store records that contain information of the modified items (previous value, modified value, field, username, etc) . We've turned to MongoDB since the records will evolve as our product catalog grows.  

## What is a Replica Set?

* A "Replica Set" is a _group of MongoDB instances (3 or more) that maintain the same data set_. This is how MongoDB facilitates high availability.

* A Replica set can have multiple nodes reflecting the primaries data set.

* In a Replica set of *3 mongod* instances you must have **one** primary capable of confirming writes. This results in two scenarios:
	1. The replica set will have have a primary and two secondaries.
	2. The replica set will have have a primary, secondary, and an "Arbiter"  

* The rest of the nodes reflect the primaries data set.

* If the primary node is unavailable, an eligible secondary node will hold an election to elect itself the new primary.
 
* Replica set members send pings "heartbeats" to each other every 2 seconds. When a ping takes longer than 10 seconds an election process takes place.

* Arbiters do not maintain a data set (extra mongod instances in a replica set) and cannot become a primary

* Arbiters offer a +1 vote thus allowing an uneven # of votes; resource cost effective way to select a replica.

  
* To print out the Replica Set Configuration run the command below -


```
rs.config()
```

  
  

* By Default clients read from the primary; however clients can specify a read preference ??????
